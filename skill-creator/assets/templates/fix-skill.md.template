# {{DOMAIN_TITLE}} Fix

Implement fixes from {{DOMAIN}}-scoring feedback. Process issues by severity (critical first), apply changes, verify each fix, re-score when complete.

## When to Use

- After running {{DOMAIN}}-scoring and receiving a scorecard
- Fixing specific {{DOMAIN}} issues identified in an audit
- Improving {{DOMAIN}} score from current grade to target grade

## Fix Process

1. Read scoring output (scorecard + issues list)
2. Read `references/overview.md` for fix priority framework
3. Read `references/implementation-workflow.md` for step-by-step process
4. For each issue, load matching `references/fix-patterns/*.md`
5. Apply fixes in severity order: critical > high > medium > low
6. Verify each fix, then re-run {{DOMAIN}}-scoring
