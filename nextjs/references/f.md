## Font Optimization

Automatic font optimization using [`next/font`](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font). Next.js self-hosts fonts, eliminates layout shift, and applies best practices for performance. Works with Google Fonts and local font files. Learn more in [Fonts](/docs/app/getting-started/fonts).

## File-system caching

A Turbopack feature that stores compiler artifacts on disk between runs, reducing work across `next dev` or `next build` commands for significantly faster compile times. Learn more in [Turbopack FileSystem Caching](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopackFileSystemCache).
