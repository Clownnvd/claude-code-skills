- [Full Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/llms-full.txt): Complete documentation content

### Versioned Documentation

Documentation for previous Next.js versions is available at `/docs/{version}/`. For example:

- `/docs/15/app/getting-started` - Next.js 15 documentation
- `/docs/14/app/getting-started` - Next.js 14 documentation

LLM-optimized documentation for specific versions:

| Version | Index | Full Content |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Current (16.x) | [/docs/llms.txt](https://nextjs.org/docs/llms.txt) | [/docs/llms-full.txt](https://nextjs.org/docs/llms-full.txt) |
| 15.x | [/docs/15/llms.txt](https://nextjs.org/docs/15/llms.txt) | - |
| 14.x | [/docs/14/llms.txt](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/llms.txt) | - |

**URL Format**: Documentation URLs support the `.md` extension for direct access. For example:
- `/docs/app/getting-started.md` works the same as `/docs/app/getting-started`

Note: When working with a specific Next.js version, use the corresponding versioned documentation to ensure accuracy.
