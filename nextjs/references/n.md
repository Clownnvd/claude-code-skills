# N

## Not Found

A special component shown when a route doesn't exist or when the [`notFound()` function](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/not-found) is called. Created by adding a [`not-found.js` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) to your app directory. Learn more in [Error Handling](/docs/app/getting-started/error-handling#not-found).
