## Environment Variables

Configuration values accessible at build time or request time. In Next.js, variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser, while others are only available server-side. Learn more in [Environment Variables](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables).

## Error Boundary

A React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child component tree and displays a fallback UI. In Next.js, create an [`error.js` file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error) to automatically wrap a route segment in an error boundary.
