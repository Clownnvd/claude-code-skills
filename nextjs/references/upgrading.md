# Upgrading

## Latest version

To update to the latest version of Next.js, you can use the `upgrade` command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
next upgrade
```

Next.js 15 and earlier do not support the `upgrade` command and need to use a separate package instead:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest
```

If you prefer to upgrade manually, install the latest Next.js and React versions:

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
```

```bash package="npm"
npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
```

## Canary version

To update to the latest canary, make sure you're on the latest version of Next.js and everything is working as expected. Then, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i next@canary
```
