It can be placed at the top of a file to indicate that all exports in the file are cacheable, or inline at the top of a function or component to mark that specific scope as cacheable. Learn more in the [`"use cache"` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache).

Learn more in the [`"use client"` reference](/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-client).

## `"use server"` Directive
