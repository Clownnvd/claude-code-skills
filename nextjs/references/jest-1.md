# Jest

Jest and React Testing Library are frequently used together for **Unit Testing** and **Snapshot Testing**. This guide will show you how to set up Jest with Next.js and write your first tests.

> **Good to know:** Since `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Jest currently does not support them. While you can still run **unit tests** for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using an **E2E tests** for `async` components.

## Quickstart

You can use `create-next-app` with the Next.js [with-jest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest) example to quickly get started:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

## Manual setup

Since the release of [Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12), Next.js now has built-in configuration for Jest.

To set up Jest, install `jest` and the following packages as dev dependencies:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom @testing-library/jest-dom ts-node @types/jest
