A fast, Rust-based bundler built for Next.js. Turbopack is the default bundler for `next dev` and available for `next build`. It provides significantly faster compilation times compared to Webpack. Learn more in [Turbopack](/docs/app/api-reference/turbopack).

## Tree Shaking

The process of removing unused code from your JavaScript bundles during the build process. Next.js automatically tree-shakes your code to reduce bundle sizes. Learn more in the [Package Bundling guide](/docs/app/guides/package-bundling).
