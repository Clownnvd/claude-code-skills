# Playwright

Playwright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** testing. This guide will show you how to set up Playwright with Next.js and write your first tests.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is to use `create-next-app` with the [with-playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright). This will create a Next.js project complete with Playwright configured.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-playwright with-playwright-app
```

## Manual setup

To install Playwright, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm init playwright
