See [Request-time rendering](#request-time-rendering).

## Dynamic route segments

[Route segments](#route-segment) that are generated from data at request time. Created by wrapping a folder name in square brackets (e.g., `[slug]`), they allow you to create routes from dynamic data like blog posts or product pages. Learn more in [Dynamic Route Segments](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/dynamic-routes).
