1,Background Colors,Base Surface,background base surface dark,The foundational background color for the entire page in dark mode. Use a dark gray rather than pure black to reduce eye strain and allow elevation hierarchy.,"Use #121212 or #0A0A0A as the base surface color, providing a soft dark foundation","Use pure #000000 as your base background — it creates harsh contrast and eliminates elevation hierarchy",<div class='dark:bg-zinc-950'> or <div class='dark:bg-[#121212]'>,<div class='dark:bg-black'>,Critical
2,Background Colors,Elevated Surface,elevated card raised surface,Elevated surfaces like cards and panels should be lighter than the base to communicate depth. Use white overlay at low opacity on the base color.,"Use #1E1E1E or #1C1C1E for elevated surfaces (cards/sheets/drawers) creating a subtle lift from the base",Use the same background for all surface levels — everything looks flat and users cannot distinguish hierarchy,<div class='dark:bg-zinc-900'> or <div class='dark:bg-[#1E1E1E]'>,<div class='dark:bg-zinc-950'> (same as base),High
3,Background Colors,Overlay Surface,modal overlay dialog backdrop,Modal and dialog overlays need a semi-transparent dark backdrop to focus attention and indicate a layer above the main content.,"Use a semi-transparent black overlay like rgba(0/0/0/0.6) for modals and #2C2C2E or zinc-800 for the modal surface itself","Use a fully opaque overlay that completely hides the content beneath or skip the overlay entirely on modals",<div class='dark:bg-black/60'><div class='dark:bg-zinc-800 rounded-lg'>,<div class='dark:bg-black'><div class='dark:bg-zinc-950'>,High
4,Background Colors,Card Background,card container panel box,Cards should feel elevated from the base surface with a subtle background shift. The difference should be perceptible but not jarring.,Use #1A1A1A to #1E1E1E for card backgrounds roughly 1-2 steps lighter than the base surface,Use borders alone without any background difference — cards blend into the base and lose visual grouping,<div class='dark:bg-zinc-900 dark:border dark:border-zinc-800 rounded-xl p-6'>,<div class='dark:bg-transparent dark:border dark:border-zinc-700'>,Medium
5,Background Colors,OLED Optimization,OLED amoled battery pure black,On OLED screens pure black (#000000) pixels are truly off saving battery. Offer an optional OLED mode with pure black base while keeping the default at #121212.,Offer an optional OLED/AMOLED mode that uses #000000 for the base surface while keeping #121212 as the default dark mode,Force pure black as the only dark mode option — it creates harsh contrast and removes elevation cues for non-OLED users,<div class='dark:bg-zinc-950 oled:bg-black'> /* custom oled variant */,<div class='dark:bg-black'> /* forced for everyone */,Medium
6,Text Colors,Primary Text,text heading body primary,Primary text in dark mode should not be pure white.

9,Text Colors,Link Colors,link anchor href interactive,Links need to stand out from surrounding text in dark mode. Desaturated blues or light accent colors work well without being too vibrant.,Use a desaturated light blue like #60A5FA (blue-400) for links ensuring clear differentiation from body text and sufficient contrast,Use saturated bright blue (#0000FF or blue-600) which vibrates against dark backgrounds and causes eye fatigue,<a class='dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300'>,<a class='dark:text-blue-600'> /* low contrast on dark bg */,High
10,Text Colors,Text on Colored Backgrounds,text contrast colored badge chip,"When placing text on colored backgrounds (badges/chips/banners) ensure adequate contrast by pairing light text with dark tints or dark text with light tints.",Test contrast ratios for every text-on-color combination; use light text (#F2F2F2) on dark-tinted badges and dark text (#1A1A1A) on light-tinted badges,Assume light text works on all colored backgrounds — medium-brightness colors like yellow or lime often fail contrast checks with white text,<span class='dark:bg-blue-900 dark:text-blue-200'>Badge</span>,<span class='dark:bg-blue-500 dark:text-white'>Badge</span> /* may fail contrast */,Critical
11,Color Adaptation,Desaturate Primary Colors,primary brand desaturate vibrant,"Brand and primary colors that look great on white backgrounds often feel neon and harsh on dark. Reduce saturation by 20-30% or shift to a lighter tint for dark mode.","Shift primary colors to the 300-400 range in dark mode (e.g. blue-600 in light becomes blue-400 in dark) reducing vibrancy while preserving brand identity",Keep the same saturated primary color from light mode — it appears neon and causes visual vibration and fatigues the eyes on dark backgrounds,"<button class='bg-blue-600 dark:bg-blue-500'> or CSS: --primary: hsl(220 70% 55%)",<button class='bg-blue-600'> /* unchanged in dark mode */,High

13,Color Adaptation,Opacity Adaptation,opacity alpha transparency,"Use opacity to create subtle layering in dark mode. White-with-opacity works for overlays and borders creating surfaces that adapt naturally to any base color.","Use white with varying opacity for elevation: 5% for level 1 / 8% for level 2 / 11% for level 3 matching Material Design surface tints",Use fixed gray hex values for each level — they break when the base surface color changes and are harder to maintain,<div class='dark:bg-white/5'> /* surface 1 */ <div class='dark:bg-white/[0.08]'> /* surface 2 */,<div class='dark:bg-[#1E1E1E]'> <div class='dark:bg-[#232323]'> /* rigid hex values */,Medium
14,Color Adaptation,Border Colors,border outline separator frame,Borders need to be visible but subtle in dark mode. Use white with low opacity or zinc-700/zinc-800 for consistent edge definition without harshness.,Use #27272A (zinc-800) or white/10 for subtle borders that define edges without creating harsh visual lines,Use bright or high-contrast borders like zinc-400 or white — they dominate the visual hierarchy and create a wireframe look,<div class='dark:border-zinc-800'> or <div class='dark:border-white/10'>,<div class='dark:border-zinc-400'> /* too bright */,High
15,Color Adaptation,Divider Colors,divider hr separator line,"Horizontal dividers and separators should be barely visible just enough to indicate section breaks without adding visual clutter.",Use #27272A (zinc-800) or white/[0.06] for dividers — they should be the most subtle element in the hierarchy,Use the same divider color from light mode or high-contrast lines that visually chop the interface into rigid sections,<hr class='dark:border-zinc-800'> or <div class='dark:divide-zinc-800'>,<hr class='dark:border-zinc-500'> /* too visible / creates rigidity */,Medium
16,Color Adaptation,Shadow Adaptation,shadow elevation depth drop,Box shadows are nearly invisible on dark backgrounds. Replace shadows with subtle border or lighter surface backgrounds to communicate elevation.,Replace shadows with subtle borders (border-zinc-800) or lighter backgrounds for elevation since shadows on dark surfaces are invisible,"Keep the same shadow values from light mode — they are invisible on dark backgrounds and provide no elevation cue wasting render effort",<div class='shadow-lg dark:shadow-none dark:border dark:border-zinc-800 dark:bg-zinc-900'>,<div class='shadow-lg'> /* invisible in dark mode */,High
17,Contrast,Minimum Contrast Ratio,contrast WCAG ratio accessibility,WCAG requires a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Verify all text-background combinations in dark mode meet these thresholds.,"Test all text-background pairs with a contrast checker; primary text on base should be at least 12:1 and secondary at least 4.5:1",Eyeball contrast without measuring — many combinations that look fine to one user fail for users with low vision or in bright ambient light,/* zinc-200 on zinc-950: ~14:1 ratio */ <p class='dark:text-zinc-200'>,/* zinc-500 on zinc-900: ~3.4:1 ratio */ <p class='dark:text-zinc-500'> /* fails AA */,Critical
18,Contrast,Avoid Pure White on Pure Black,contrast harsh halation glare,Pure white (#FFFFFF) on pure black (#000000) creates a 21:1 ratio which causes halation — the text appears to bleed into the background for many users.,"Use off-white (#E5E5E5 to #F2F2F2) on dark gray (#121212 to #1A1A1A) for a comfortable 13-16:1 ratio that is accessible without causing halation","Use #FFFFFF on #000000 — the maximum 21:1 contrast causes text to glow and swim particularly for users with astigmatism (roughly 50% of the population)",<body class='dark:bg-zinc-950 dark:text-zinc-200'>,<body class='dark:bg-black dark:text-white'>,Critical
19,Contrast,Reduce Contrast for Comfort,eye strain fatigue comfort reading,"For long-form reading and dashboard interfaces slightly reduce contrast to minimize eye fatigue during extended viewing sessions.","Use zinc-300 (#D4D4D8) on zinc-950 for long-form text providing ~11:1 ratio that is highly accessible yet comfortable for sustained reading",Use maximum contrast for all text regardless of context — reading interfaces at high contrast for long periods causes eye strain and headaches,<article class='dark:text-zinc-300 dark:bg-zinc-950 leading-relaxed'>,<article class='dark:text-white dark:bg-black'>,Medium
20,Contrast,Icon Contrast,icon svg glyph symbol,"Icons and glyphs need sufficient contrast but often serve as secondary information. Use slightly reduced contrast compared to primary text while staying above 3:1.","Use zinc-400 (#A1A1AA) for decorative icons and zinc-300 for interactive icons ensuring 3:1 minimum for non-text elements per WCAG 2.1",Use the same color as disabled text for active icons — users cannot tell which icons are interactive versus decorative,<svg class='dark:text-zinc-400'> /* decorative */ <button><svg class='dark:text-zinc-300'> /* interactive */,<svg class='dark:text-zinc-600'> /* too dim for interactive icons */,High
21,Contrast,Status Color Adaptation,status error success warning info,Status colors (red/green/yellow/blue) must be adapted for dark mode. Use lighter tints of each to maintain meaning and contrast on dark surfaces.,"Use lighter tints: red-400 for errors / emerald-400 for success / amber-400 for warnings / blue-400 for info — all maintaining 4.5:1 on dark surfaces","Use the same status colors from light mode (red-600/green-600) — they lose contrast and vibrancy on dark backgrounds and fail accessibility checks",<span class='dark:text-red-400'>Error</span> <span class='dark:text-emerald-400'>Success</span>,<span class='dark:text-red-600'>Error</span> /* low contrast on dark bg */,Critical
22,Images & Media,Reduce Image Brightness,image photo brightness filter,Bright images on a dark interface create jarring contrast. Slightly reduce brightness and increase contrast of images to blend better with the dark surroundings.,Apply a subtle brightness reduction (85-90%) and slight contrast increase to images in dark mode using CSS filters,Leave images at full brightness — they act like flashlights on the page drawing disproportionate attention and causing discomfort,<img class='dark:brightness-90 dark:contrast-105'>,<img> /* no dark mode adjustment */,Medium
23,Images & Media,Dark Overlay on Hero Images,hero banner overlay gradient image,Hero and banner images with text overlays need darker gradients in dark mode to maintain text readability without the light-mode gradient looking out of place.,Use a darker gradient overlay (from black/70 to transparent) on hero images in dark mode ensuring text remains legible,Use the same light-mode overlay gradient which often goes from white/50 — this creates a washed out gray appearance on dark interfaces,<div class='bg-gradient-to-t from-black/70 dark:from-black/80 to-transparent'>,<div class='bg-gradient-to-t from-white/50 to-transparent'> /* looks gray in dark mode */,High
24,Images & Media,SVG Color Adaptation,svg icon vector fill stroke,"SVGs using hardcoded fill or stroke colors will not adapt to dark mode. Use currentColor or CSS custom properties to make SVGs theme-aware.",Use currentColor for fills and strokes then control color via the parent text color class so SVGs automatically adapt to dark mode,Hardcode fill='#000000' or fill='#333' in SVGs — they become invisible on dark backgrounds and require manual overrides per icon,<svg fill='currentColor' class='dark:text-zinc-200'>,<svg fill='#333333'> /* invisible on dark bg */,Critical
25,Images & Media,Favicon Dark Variant,favicon tab icon browser theme,Provide a dark-mode variant of your favicon so it remains visible in browser tabs when the system or browser uses a dark theme.,"Use SVG favicon with prefers-color-scheme media query inside it or provide both light and dark PNG favicons with media attribute",Use only a dark-colored favicon — it becomes invisible in browser tabs when the user has dark mode enabled in their OS,"<link rel='icon' href='/favicon-light.svg' media='(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'>","<link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico'> /* single dark icon invisible in dark tab bar */",Medium
26,Components,Button Variants Dark,button CTA action primary secondary,Buttons need distinct visual treatment in dark mode.
