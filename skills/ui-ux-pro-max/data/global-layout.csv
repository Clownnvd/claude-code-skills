1,Container,Max-Width Container,"max-width, container, content width, center, wrapper","All page content must be contained within a consistent max-width container, centered horizontally.","Use max-w-7xl (1280px) or max-w-6xl (1152px) consistently across all sections. Center with mx-auto. Add horizontal padding px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8.","Don't mix different max-widths across sections (max-w-5xl in hero, max-w-7xl in features).

2,Container,Full-Bleed Sections,"full bleed, full width, edge to edge, background extend","Some sections need full-width backgrounds (hero, CTA, footer) while keeping content contained within max-width.","Use full-width wrapper for background, nested max-width container for content. Background extends edge-to-edge, content stays contained.","Don't make content full-width (unreadable on large screens).

3,Spacing,Section Spacing,"section padding, vertical spacing, section gap, py","Consistent vertical padding between page sections creates visual rhythm and readability.","Use py-16 (64px) for mobile, md:py-24 (96px) for desktop as base section spacing. Use py-20 md:py-32 for hero sections. Keep consistent across all sections.","Don't use different paddings for each section. Don't use less than py-12 (48px) for any section. Don't use margins between sections (use padding inside).","<section class=""py-16 md:py-24"">Features section</section><section class=""py-16 md:py-24"">Testimonials section</section>","<section class=""py-8"">Features</section><section class=""py-20"">Testimonials</section> <!-- Inconsistent spacing -->",HIGH
4,Spacing,Base Spacing Scale,"spacing scale, gap, margin, padding, 4px grid","All spacing values must follow a consistent scale based on 4px (0.25rem) increments.","Use Tailwind spacing scale: 1(4px) 2(8px) 3(12px) 4(16px) 6(24px) 8(32px) 10(40px) 12(48px) 16(64px) 20(80px) 24(96px). Use gap for flex/grid children.","Don't use arbitrary values (margin: 13px, padding: 7px). Don't mix rem and px.

5,Z-Index,Z-Index Scale,"z-index, stacking, layer, overlay, z","Standardized z-index values prevent stacking context conflicts.

Don't compete with z-indexes (navbar z-50 vs modal z-50).

6,Grid,Grid System,"grid, columns, layout grid, css grid, flex grid","Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for page layouts. Standard 12-column grid for complex layouts, flex for simple ones.","Use grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 for card layouts. Use grid-cols-12 for complex layouts with col-span-*. Use gap-6 or gap-8 between grid items.","Don't use float for layouts. Don't manually calculate widths (width: 33.33%).

7,Navbar,Floating Navbar Spacing,"floating nav, navbar spacing, nav offset, content offset","Floating navbar (fixed position with margin from edges) requires content offset to prevent overlap.","Add pt-24 or pt-28 to main content container when using floating navbar. Navbar uses top-4 left-4 right-4 with rounded corners. Calculate offset = navbar height + top margin + extra spacing.","Don't use top-0 left-0 right-0 for floating navbar (use top-4 left-4 right-4).

9,Layout,Sticky Footer,"sticky footer, footer bottom, min height, page footer","Footer must always appear at the bottom of the viewport even when content is short (not fixed, just pushed down).","Use min-h-screen on page wrapper with flex flex-col. Footer gets mt-auto. OR use grid with grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] on body/wrapper.","Don't use fixed positioning for footer (covers content). Don't use absolute bottom-0 (overlaps content).

10,Layout,Content Width for Readability,"readable width, text width, prose, line length, max chars","Body text content (blog posts, articles, long-form) should be constrained for readability (65-75 chars per line).","Use max-w-prose (65ch) or max-w-3xl for text-heavy content. Center with mx-auto. Works within larger grid layouts. Use Tailwind prose class for articles.","Don't let text span full max-w-7xl container (too wide to read).

Modals: p-6 to p-8. Form groups: space-y-4 to space-y-6. Button groups: gap-3 to gap-4. List items: py-3 to py-4.","Don't use different padding for similar components.

Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.","Don't add custom breakpoints unless absolutely necessary. Don't forget to test between breakpoints (600px, 900px).

13,Layout,Page Transitions,"page transition, route animation, navigation animation, view transition","Smooth transitions between page navigations enhance perceived performance and UX.","Use CSS View Transitions API or Framer Motion page transitions. Fade-in for new content (opacity 0 to 1, 200-300ms). Use layout animations for shared elements.","Don't use slow transitions (>500ms) that delay content.
