# Content & Conversion Criteria

Covers categories 8-9: Content & Copy (8%), Conversion & CTA (10%).

## 8. Content & Copy (8%)

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] User-focused language ("you" not "we")
- [ ] Clear value proposition in first 5 seconds
- [ ] No jargon or buzzwords
- [ ] Specific claims with evidence
- [ ] Consistent tone and voice

### Messaging Quality
- **5-second test**: Can visitor answer "Where am I?", "What can I do?", "Why should I?" in 5 seconds?
- User-focused: "you/your" not "we/our"
- Specific: "Saves 20 hours/week" beats "Saves time"
- No jargon unless audience expects it
- Consistent voice throughout

### Content Structure
- Headlines summarize content (not "Introduction" or "Section 1")
- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max), scannable via bold/lists/subheadings
- Logical flow: Problem → Solution → Proof → Action

### Social Proof
- Testimonials: name, photo, role, company, specific result
- No stock photos — real people only
- Logos: recognizable brands or quantity ("100+ companies")
- Stats specific: "4,521 users" not "thousands"

**Scoring:** 9-10: Compelling, every word earns its place | 7-8: Clear, minor copy issues | 5-6: Functional but generic | 3-4: Vague, wall of text, jargon | 0-2: Confusing, lorem ipsum, no proof

**Common issues:** Feature dump vs benefits, "Click here"/"Submit" labels, generic testimonials, missing social proof, inconsistent capitalization.

## 9. Conversion & CTA (10%)

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Single primary CTA per viewport
- [ ] CTA stands out visually (contrast, size)
- [ ] CTA copy is action-specific (not "Submit" or "Click Here")
- [ ] Social proof near CTA (testimonials, stats, logos)
- [ ] Friction reducers present ("No credit card required")

### CTA Design
- Visual prominence: most dominant interactive element
- Color contrast against background (not same as nav)
- Size: min 44px height, ideally 48-56px
- Whitespace: breathing room around CTA
- Consistent style throughout page

### CTA Copy
- Action-specific: "Start free trial" / "Get template — $99" / "Deploy now"
- Creates urgency/value: "Save 20 hours this week"
- Never "Submit", "Click here", "Learn more" as primary

### CTA Placement
- Above fold (hero), after proof points (features, testimonials), end of page (final CTA)
- Optional: sticky header CTA on scroll

### Friction Reduction
- Microcopy: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime", "14-day free trial"
- Trust badges near payment (Stripe secure, SSL, money-back)
- Secondary CTA for uncommitted ("See demo", "View pricing")

### Conversion Flow
- Single primary per viewport (not 3 competing buttons)
- Extra offers reduce conversion up to 266% (Unbounce)
- Form fields minimized (name + email, not 10 fields)

**Scoring:** 9-10: CTA impossible to miss, compelling copy, friction eliminated | 7-8: Good visibility, minor issues | 5-6: Present but doesn't stand out | 3-4: Buried or competing, no friction reduction | 0-2: No clear CTA

### Benchmarks (SaaS landing pages)
- Median conversion: 3.8% | Top 25%: 11.6%+ | Top 10%: 23.1%+
